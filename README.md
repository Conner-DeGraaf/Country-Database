# Country-Database

## What it is?
This is a database of over 200 contries that was web-scrapped from this website https://www.scrapethissite.com/pages/simple/
In there, I used the countries data to be able to query information about them. 

## Languages / Libraries
Language: python

I recently learned how to use request and BeautifulSoup libraries in combination to extract data from websites. 


## Challenges
- Wasn't sure what 'html.parser' was in the BeautifulSoup library
- Ironically (not sure if I was just tired) the print_list() function
- Finding a good __str__ method for the countries data to be printed to the console.

## Methods for database
    def import_data(self):

    def count_countries(self):

    def search_country(self, name):
  
    def country_capital(self, name):

    def search_population(self, number, value):
   
    def search_area(self , number, value):
      
    def population_extreme(self, value):

    def area_extreme(self, value):

## Uses
Not sure what to use it for but it was great practice and look forward to trying more webscrapping fun, maybe something in research XD
